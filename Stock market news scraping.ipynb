If a stock quotes at Rs 100 in the spot market and the same trades at Rs 100.50 in futures, then the fund manager looks to buy it in the spot market and simultaneously sell it in the futures market. By the time of expiry the prices converge and the fund manager reverses the transaction and pockets the price differential (technically known as spot future spread) minus transaction costs. The idea is to avoid stock market risk and focus on the arbitrage—the price differential.

The short-term yields generally act as a parameter of cost of funds and is one of the key inputs in deciding the premium at which the future price of a stock trades, compared to the spot price. This means arbitrage funds tend to track the very short-term yields and can offer better returns in a rising interest rate regime.',\n",

Though it is not easy for an average investor to figure out the quantum of money being laid upon this strategy, investors need to keep an eye on the monthly spot-futures spreads to figure out if the strategy is still attractive or consult their advisors,” says Joydeep Sen, corporate trainer (debt).',\n",
       "  'If the broad market has exhibited severe selling, then the prices of stocks in the futures market start quoting at a discount to the spot price and in such cases the spot-future arbitrage opportunity vanishes. Though such situations are rare, an investor may come across a sideways market with negative bias wherein few stocks are quoting at an attractive premium in the futures market compared to the spot market, leading to relatively lower returns.',\n",

For units held for a shorter period, the gains are taxed at 15 percent. This is better than the tax treatment for interest on fixed deposits and gains booked on units of debt funds held for less than 36 months, where the gains are taxed as per the slab rate.',\n",
       "  'But you should never consider these schemes as an ideal parking place for short-term funds or an alternative to liquid funds. And there are reasons for the same.',\n",
       "  '“An arbitrage fund generates the bulk of its returns by initiating arbitrage trade including rollovers and a part of its returns are also generated by capturing the intra-month volatility. On an average, a period of three months and beyond gives the investment enough time to settle in the trade and higher chances to enhance the return by capturing the market volatility,” says Jain.',\n",
       "  'Sen advocates an investment horizon of at least six months and ideally of one year to ensure that you are not caught on the wrong side of the volatility.',\n",

Also, when you redeem money in liquid funds, the proceeds come back on the next working day, but in arbitrage funds it takes t+3 days, so it may not serve the purpose of a liquid fund which in many cases is used as an emergency fund, she adds.',\n",

When you invest in fixed-income securities, you become a lender to the company or the government issuing the bonds, making your investment more of a loan. This makes your investment much safer, compared to the equity market, as the bond-issuer is bound to pay your money back. Further, for extending this loan, the bond issuer or lender agrees to pay you a fixed interest rate, also known as coupon. Since the interest rate, or coupon, is pre-decided at the time of the bond’s issue, these securities are termed as fixed-income securities.',\n",

       "  'The coupon indicates the interest paid on the fixed-income security. For instance, a five-year bond rated AAA, which has a very low chance of defaulting, may offer you a coupon of 7 percent per year, till the time of its maturity, which will be after five years. This is the coupon on the bond and you will receive this amount at pre-defined intervals.',\n",
       "  'If you stay invested through the bond’s duration, you will receive the principal amount at the end of the five-year period.',\n",
       "  'One important thing to remember here: do not get carried away just by looking at a bond’s coupon rate. This means that you must not simply opt for a bond which has a higher coupon rate. The coupon rate is directly influenced by the risk that the issuer carries. Issuers that are deemed high-risk need to offer a higher coupon rate to compensate for the higher risk. On the other hand, well-rated issuers, i.e., those with a credit rating of AAA or higher, don’t really need to offer very high coupon rates to raise money. Thus, a higher coupon could mean higher risk – something that you must examine before investing in a bond portfolio.',\n",
       "  'The other source of income is capital gains, which indicates the change in the price of the fixed-income security, in line with the changes in yields.',\n",
       "  'First thing, the yield of a bond is different from the coupon rate. A bond’s yield is the overall rate of return on a bond, while the coupon, as discussed, is the interest rate offered on the bond. The price of the bond is inversely related to the yield, which means that when the bond’s price is lower than its face value, indicating a lack of demand, the yield, or the actual returns, will potentially be higher than the pre-decided coupon. Conversely, when the demand is higher, the price will also be higher, pulling the yield below the coupon rate. The yield may be impacted by a variety of factors, including movements in the RBI’s repo rate, inflation numbers, and other statistics like GDP projections and figures. Even a sharp surge in equities could cause low demand for bonds, leading to a rise in yields and a fall in bond prices.',\n",

These levels are above long-term averages. Also, the crisis-induced loose fiscal and monetary conditions are expected to normalise. Therefore, some heightened volatility around these levels is reasonable to expect.

Unlike, say, 10 years back, software exports are now higher than oil imports. Growing services exports and oil import volumes rising at a much slower pace are improving our resilience to higher oil prices and that is one reason why the impact of the spike in oil prices on currency / markets has been muted this time.

At such times, one should reduce exposure to these and focus elsewhere.',\n",
